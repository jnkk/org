* TODO Type of website

There are 2 main type of websites.
- Static, which the user or in this case the "maker" can modify the contents. Like a blog, or a company website.

- Dynamic, which contains databases. Each of the users can create, delete and modify its content.
  Like a forum/discussion board or social media.

** Static Website using Astro.

Follow their documentations to create a blog.


** Dynamic Website using Django.

Django "workflows."

There are a lot going on in django, NOT including the frontend. Only backend.
Once the frontend is "displayed" properly, I hope it will become easier.
